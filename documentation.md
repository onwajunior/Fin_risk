# 📊 Financial Risk Analyzer - Complete Developer Guide

*Welcome, new engineer! This guide will help you understand our Financial Risk Analyzer codebase using real-world metaphors and clear explanations.*

---

## 🌟 What Is This Application?

Think of our **Financial Risk Analyzer** as a **sophisticated medical diagnostic system for companies**. Just like how doctors run tests to determine if a patient is healthy or at risk of illness, our system analyzes companies' financial "vital signs" to predict if they might face bankruptcy or financial distress.

### 🏥 The Medical Metaphor

## 🔄 How It All Works (The Patient Journey)

### 1. 🚪 **Reception (Frontend)**
```javascript
// Like a hospital reception where patients check in
// Users can input companies individually or upload a CSV list
```

**Real-world analogy**: When you visit a hospital, you first go to reception to register. Similarly, users come to our web interface to "register" companies for analysis.

### 2. 📋 **Patient Registration (Input Processing)**
```javascript
// InputSection.js - Like filling out medical forms
const handleAnalysis = async (companies) => {
  // Prepare the "patient list" for examination
  const results = await analyzeCompanies(companies);
};
```

### 3. 🔬 **Laboratory Tests (Data Collection)**
```javascript
// financialDataService.js - Like running blood tests
async resolveCompanyTicker(companyInput) {
  // Find the right "patient" in our records
  // Get their "vital signs" (financial data)
}
```

**Real-world analogy**: Just like a lab technician needs to find the right patient and collect blood samples, our Financial Data Service finds the right company and collects its financial "vital signs."

### 4. 🧮 **Medical Analysis (Ratio Calculations)**
```javascript
// ratioCalculatorService.js - Like analyzing blood test results
calculateAltmanZScore(balanceSheet, incomeStatement, marketData) {
  // Calculate the "health score" like cholesterol levels
  // Determine if the company is "healthy" or "at risk"
}
```

### 5. 🤖 **Expert Consultation (AI Analysis)**
```javascript
// aiAnalysisService.js - Like consulting with a specialist doctor
async generateAnalysis(company, ratios, marketData) {
  // Get AI expert opinion on the financial health
  // Provide recommendations like a specialist would
}
```

### 6. 📋 **Medical Report (PDF Generation)**
```javascript
// reportGeneratorService.js - Like creating a comprehensive medical report
async generatePDFReport(analysisResults) {
  // Create a detailed report for the "patient"
  // Include diagnosis, recommendations, and charts
}
```

---

## 🧩 Key Components Explained

### 🚪 Frontend Components (The Hospital Reception)

#### **InputSection.js** - Registration Desk
```javascript
// Like the hospital intake form
// Patients can register individually or in groups (CSV upload)
const InputSection = ({ onAnalyze }) => {
  // Two ways to check in:
  // 1. Individual company entry (walk-in patient)
  // 2. CSV batch upload (group medical screening)
};
```

**What it does**: 
- Allows users to input companies for analysis
- Supports individual entry or CSV batch upload
- Validates input and shows preview of companies

#### **CompanyCard.js** - Patient File Display
```javascript
// Like a patient's medical chart on the wall
// Shows the company's "vital signs" and diagnosis
const CompanyCard = ({ company, analysis }) => {
  // Display financial health status
  // Show risk level with color coding (green=healthy, red=critical)
};
```

#### **AnalysisResults.js** - Medical Results Board
```javascript
// Like the results board in a doctor's office
// Shows all analyzed companies and their health status
```

### 🔬 Backend Services (The Laboratory)

#### **FinancialDataService.js** - Data Collection Lab
```javascript
class FinancialDataService {
  // Like a lab that collects blood samples from multiple sources
  constructor() {
    this.dataSources = {
      alphavantage: { /* Source 1: Like Lab A */ },
      financialModelingPrep: { /* Source 2: Like Lab B */ },
      yahooFinance: { /* Source 3: Like Lab C */ }
    };
  }
}
```

**Real-world analogy**: Just like hospitals get lab results from multiple testing facilities to ensure accuracy, we collect financial data from multiple sources (Alpha Vantage, Financial Modeling Prep, Yahoo Finance) to get comprehensive and reliable information.

#### **RatioCalculatorService.js** - Analysis Laboratory
```javascript
class RatioCalculatorService {
  // Like a medical lab that analyzes blood samples
  calculateAltmanZScore(balanceSheet, incomeStatement, marketData) {
    // Calculate financial ratios like:
    // - Liquidity ratios (like blood pressure)
    // - Leverage ratios (like cholesterol levels)
    // - Profitability ratios (like heart rate)
    
    // The Altman Z-Score is like an overall health score
    // Z > 2.99 = Healthy (green zone)
    // 1.8 < Z < 2.99 = Caution (yellow zone)  
    // Z < 1.8 = High risk (red zone)
  }
}
```

#### **AIAnalysisService.js** - Specialist Consultant
```javascript
class AIAnalysisService {
  // Like consulting with a financial specialist doctor
  async generateAnalysis(company, ratios, marketData) {
    // Use OpenAI (like consulting with an expert)
    // Provide human-readable diagnosis and recommendations
  }
}
```

#### **ReportGeneratorService.js** - Medical Records Department
```javascript
class ReportGeneratorService {
  // Like creating comprehensive medical reports
  async generatePDFReport(analysisResults) {
    // Create professional reports with:
    // - Charts and graphs (like X-rays)
    // - Analysis summary (like diagnosis)
    // - Recommendations (like treatment plan)
  }
}
```

## 📡 API Routes (Hospital Communication System)

### 🔬 Analysis Routes (`/api/analysis/`)
```javascript
// routes/analysis.js - Main diagnostic center

// POST /api/analysis/analyze
// Like: "Please analyze these patients"
router.post('/analyze', async (req, res) => {
  // Receive list of companies to analyze
  // Run them through our diagnostic process
  // Return health status for each
});

// POST /api/analysis/upload  
// Like: "Here's a list of patients for group screening"
router.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), async (req, res) => {
  // Accept CSV file with company names
  // Parse and validate the list
  // Return processed company list
});
```

### 🏢 Company Routes (`/api/company/`)
```javascript
// routes/company.js - Patient information center

// GET /api/company/search/:query
// Like: "Find patient records for John Smith"
router.get('/search/:query', async (req, res) => {
  // Search for company information
  // Return basic company details
});
```

### 📋 Report Routes (`/api/report/`)
```javascript
// routes/report.js - Medical records department

// POST /api/report/generate
// Like: "Generate medical report for this patient"
router.post('/generate', async (req, res) => {
  // Create comprehensive PDF report
  // Include charts, analysis, recommendations
});
```

PORT=3001
```

### 3. 🏃‍♂️ Start the Hospital
```bash
# Start both backend and frontend
npm run dev:full

# Or start individually:
npm run dev          # Backend only (port 3001)
cd frontend && npm start  # Frontend only (port 3000)
```

### 4. 🌐 Visit the Hospital
- **Reception Desk**: http://localhost:3000 (Frontend)
- **Internal Systems**: http://localhost:3001/api (Backend APIs)

---

## 🧪 Testing the System

### 🩺 Basic Health Check
```bash
# Test if the hospital is running
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

## 🛠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### 🚨 "Company not found" Error
**Problem**: Like trying to find a patient who's not in the system
**Solution**: 
- Use exact ticker symbols (AAPL, not Apple)
- Check spelling
- Ensure company is publicly traded

### 🔑 API Rate Limits
**Problem**: Like running out of lab tests for the day
**Solution**:
- Wait for rate limit reset
- Use multiple API keys
- Implement caching (already done!)

### 💾 Server Memory Issues
**Problem**: Like the hospital computer running out of memory
**Solution**:
- Use memory storage for Vercel (already implemented)
- Clear cache periodically
- Optimize file processing

### 📊 Missing Financial Data
**Problem**: Like incomplete medical records
**Solution**:
- Try different company ticker
- Check if company has recent financial filings
- Use alternative data sources
